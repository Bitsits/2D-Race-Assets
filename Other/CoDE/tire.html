<h2><a name="SECTION00011000000000000000">Tire Model in Driving Simulator</a></h2>
<p>
The primary forces during lateral maneuvering, acceleration, and
braking are generated by tires as a function of the driver input.
The linear analysis of a tire model commonly considers constant
tire side force coefficients at small force output range. The
linear tire model doesn't consider longitudinal tire forces due to
the complex interactions between lateral and longitudinal tire
forces. Thus, linear tire model is suitable for analyzing a stable
vehicle behavior under the assumption of small steering and
acceleration. Most of AHS (Automated Highway System) utilize the
linear tire model for its simplicity. In our driving simulator, it
is very important to describe the exact behavior of a vehicle in
any driving scenario including inclement driving conditions which
may require severe steering, braking, acceleration, and other
driving related operations. Therefore, in order to simulate the
complete vehicle operational range, it is important to properly
model tire forces containing the interactions of longitudinal and
lateral forces from small levels through saturation. The tire
model used in the driving simulator is based on a paper from U.S
Department of Transportation [1]. The paper presents
complete computations of the tire forces by using the parameters
available from various tire test results including comprehensive
Calspan model and data. The tire model developed in this paper
provides a useful force producing element for a full
driver/vehicle model as in our driving simulator. In the following
sections, physical and analytical tire model is presented with
basic tire variables followed by the identified model equations
and resulting plots. Especially, the tire force plots provide not
only the validation of this tire model, but also insights into
tire effects on vehicle response and stability.
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00012000000000000000">Slip Angle and Longitudinal Slip</a></h2>
<p>
The longitudinal and lateral forces generated by a tire are a
function of the slip angle and longitudinal slip
of the tire relative to the road.

<strong>Figure 1:</strong> Basic
Variables of Tire<br>
</p><p>
The longitudinal slip of the tire is defined as a difference
between the tire tangential speed and the speed of
the axle relative to the road, which is represented by
the following equation.
</p><p><a name="eqslip">&nbsp;</a> 
<img alt="equation19" src="tire_files/img2.gif" align="bottom" width="500" height="94"> </p><p>
where <i>S</i> is the longitudinal slip, <i>R</i> is the radius of the
wheel,  
<img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline455" src="tire_files/img3.gif" align="bottom" width="11" height="9">  is the angular velocity, and <i>u</i> is the speed of the
axle illustrated in Figure 1. The value of the longitudinal
slip is limited such that  
<img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline459" src="tire_files/img4.gif" align="middle" width="55" height="30"> . For braking, axle speed is
used in the denominator so that longitudinal slip is 1 when
 <img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline455" src="tire_files/img3.gif" align="bottom" width="11" height="9">  is zero. Slip has the opposite sign when tracking
force is generated. <br>
When the tire develops a sideslip velocity denoted by <i>v</i> in Figure 1, a lateral force will develop opposing the
sideslip velocity. This lateral force is a function of slip angle,
where slip angle is defined as

<img alt="equation37" src="tire_files/img5.gif" align="bottom" width="500" height="35"> </p><p>
where <i>v</i> is the sideslip velocity, and <i>u</i> is the speed of the
axle. The value of the slip angle is limited such that
 <img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline469" src="tire_files/img6.gif" align="middle" width="71" height="30"> .
</p><h2><a name="SECTION00015000000000000000">Simplified Tire Model Equations</a></h2>
<p>
The previous theoretical developments lead to a complex, highly
non-linear composite force as a function of composite slip. It is
convenient to define a saturation function,  
<img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline509" src="tire_files/img24.gif" align="middle" width="34" height="30"> , to obtain
a composite force with any normal load and coefficient of friction
values such that

In order to derive a simplified computational formulas for our
driving simulator, the complex polynomial expression can replaced
the complex saturation function with all the considerations in previous
section within the agreeable error ranges. The polynomial expression
of the saturation function is presented by

specific tires. Table 1 summarizes the tire
parameters of 3 different type of tires. RWD bias ply tire model
is used for all the driving simulation presented in this paper.
The calculation of the composite slip shown in Equation 7 should be modified because the tire contact patch
length varies depending on the normal load. The tire contact patch
length are calculated using following two equations.

The lateral and longitudinal stiffness coefficients are a
function of tire contact patch length and normal load of the tire
as expressed as follows.

Given the polynomial saturation function in Equation 10 and lateral and longitudinal stiffness, the
normalized lateral and longitudinal forces are derived by
resolving the composite force into the side slip angle and
longitudinal slip ratio components.

lateral force has an additional components due to the tire camber
angle,  
<img alt="tex2html_wrap_inline569" src="tire_files/img48.gif" align="MIDDLE" width="10" height="18"> , which is modeled as a linear effect. Under significant
maneuvering conditions with large lateral and longitudinal slip,
the force converges to a common sliding friction value. In order
to meet this criteria, the longitudinal stiffness coefficient
is modified at high slips to transition to lateral stiffness coefficient
as well as the coefficient of friction defined by the parameter
